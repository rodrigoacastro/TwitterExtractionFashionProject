# TwitterExtractionFashionProject
Scripts for extracting tweets for a friend's Phd Project on fashion tweets and saving locally. This process can be used for extracting files from any accounts, within the Twitter api limits. Their limits include certain number of extractions, then there is wait time of 15 minutes, besides connection errors, that can happen for a number of reasons.

# Potentially issues known to be improved
- All files per month are created, necessarily, before the full extraction.
